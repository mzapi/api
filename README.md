# MaNGOS Zero API

The goal of this project is the provide an abstracted layer which makes interacting with the MaNGOS Zero Database and Core extremely simple and accessible. Primarily this API is being developed in conjunction with a personal Node.js desktop application which serves as an administrative tool for Game Masters and Administrators.

## MaNGOS Zero Database Support

This application is designed to work specifically with version develop21. As this software reaches pre-release and release candidate status, release versions will directly match the MaNGOS Zero revisions.â„¢

## API Documentation

API Documentation is being maintained as well as a mock server through Apiary.

  - [Realms Module](http://docs.mzeroapirealms.apiary.io)

## Postman Collection

For your convenience and testing purposes, a Postman collection has been created to interact with the API directly without any front-end.
